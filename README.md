# Minimal manga reader made with flutter.

The main purpose of the project is practice with the flutter framework and also creating an open source alternative manga reader.

For now only linux is supported but when the MVP is done i will add windows and mac support.

MVP:

- Creating and removing a library.
- Opening a book for reading.
- Basic UI styling.
- Maybe a reader mode (2page view/ right to left reading).

# V1- MVP

- Add a parallelized process to downscale images

- Finish library and reader views.

- Support more than the .zip and .cbz file formats.

- Basic functionalities like Right to left reading and 1 page and 2 page views.
  This is done for the list reading mode but single page mode is not jet implmented.

- Basic polish (eg. swithcing pages, handeling keybord events etc.).

# V2 - Current

- dynamic theme
- Settings page
- Add refresh func to lib
- Add edit func to lib element
- Redo/update thae add lib modal
- Add a local db to remember what is being red, where the user stoped etc..
- Redo the reader image view (spacing, sizing)

# V3 - TODO

- Add more interactions like swapping page based on mouse click
