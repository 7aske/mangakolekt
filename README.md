# Minimal manga reader made with flutter.

The main purpose of the project is practice with the flutter framework and also creating an open source alternative manga reader.

For now only linux is supported but when the MVP is done i will add windows and mac support.

MVP:

- Creating and removing a library.
- Opening a book for reading.
- Basic UI styling.
- Maybe a reader mode (2page view/ right to left reading).

## TODO v1

- Add a parallelized process to downscale images

- Finish library and reader views.

- Support more than the .zip and .cbz file formats.

- Basic functionalities like Right to left reading and 1 page and 2 page views.
  This is done for the list reading mode but single page mode is not jet implmented.

- Basic polish (eg. swithcing pages, handeling keybord events etc.).
